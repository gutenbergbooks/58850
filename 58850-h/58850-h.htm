<p>Abe Lincoln, the late President of the United
States of America, was born on the 12th of
February, 1809, in Hardin County, in the State
of Kentucky. His grandfather, who emigrated
from Virginia to the above State, was slain by the
Indians in 1784. Thomas Lincoln, father of the
President, and Nancy Hawks, his mother, were
natives of Virginia. The opportunities for education
enjoyed by Abraham were few and far
between, for at an early age his father needed
his assistance in clearing the forest, and making
it a fitting dwelling place for man. Still, whenever
an opportunity presented itself, it was
eagerly grasped, and the result was that, despite
of untoward circumstances, Abraham succeeded
in acquiring a decent knowledge of his mother
tongue and the rudiments of an ordinary education.</p>

<p>&#8220;At nineteen,&#8221; says one of his biographers, &#8220;we
find him serving as a common bargeman on a
boat plying to New Orleans. In March, 1830, he
accompanied his father to Macon County, Illinois,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
and helped him to build a log cabin for the family
home, and he made enough rails to fence in ten
acres of land. The next year he was employed
as a boat builder to assist in building a flat-bottomed
boat, which he afterwards took to New
Orleans, and upon his return his employer put
him in charge of a store in Illinois.</p>

<p>&#8220;In 1832, when the &#8216;Black Hawk War&#8217; broke
out, he joined a company of Volunteer Rifles;
and such was his popularity that he was almost
immediately unanimously chosen captain by his
comrades&mdash;an unexpected piece of good fortune
which he often said gave him greater pleasure
than any subsequent success in life. Here he
served for three months only, when he was proposed
as a candidate for the Legislature of
Illinois, but his opponents being in a majority he
was defeated. Soon after this he was appointed
post-master of New Salem; and now, having a
little leisure time on his hands, he began to
study law, borrowing of an evening books from a
neighbouring lawyer, and returning them the
next morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;A survey of Sangamon County was ordered
by the Government about this time, and the surveyor
offered to depute Mr. Lincoln to survey
that portion of the work lying in his part of the
county. Nothing daunted, he procured a treatise
on surveying, and after reading it, purchased a
compass and chain, and <i>did the work</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;In 1834 he was elected member of the Legislature
of Illinois by a large majority, and was re-elected
in 1836, 1838, and 1840. In 1836 he obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
a licence to practice law, and he removed to
Springfield, where he entered into partnership
with a Mr. Stuart, and rose rapidly in public
favour, being very successful as an advocate in
jury trials.</p>

<p>&#8220;In 1834 he was elected as one of the members
of Congress for Illinois. As soon as his Congressional
term had expired, he returned to the
study of the law until 1856, when we find him
nominated for the Vice-Presidency by the Illinois
delegates to the Republican States Convention of
that year, but this nomination was overruled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two years afterwards and the Convention
met at Springfield, and he was unanimously
elected as a candidate for the Senate in opposition
to Mr. Douglas. In 1860 the Convention met at
Chicago to ballot for a candidate for the Presidency,
and after a severe and prolonged struggle
Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the
United States of America.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fearful struggle which commenced upon his
elevation to the high office of President, is by far
too recent to necessitate description. Suffice it to
say that from the commencement to the end, the
great trait in Lincoln&#8217;s character was ever active,
viz., indomitable perseverance. This valuable
characteristic served him in lieu of more brilliant
qualities, and enabled him to outreach men of far
larger capacity and infinitely higher genius. He
was brutally assassinated in the presence of his
wife and friends by John Wilkes Booth, while
witnessing a dramatic representation at Washington,
on the 14th day of April, 1865.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ABE LINCOLN,<br />
THE<br />
GREAT AMERICAN JESTER.</h2></div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_hr.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<h3><i>Lincoln and Meagher.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Lincoln&#8217;s receiving a dispatch from Meagher,
the Irish General, stating that he had succeeded in
capturing an entire division of the seceders, the
president remarked that &#8220;it was good news, if true;
but he suspected it was <i>Meagher</i> (mere) humbug!&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Hooker&#8217;s Appointment.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Seaward proposed that fighting Joe
Hooker should have the command of an entire
brigade, Lincoln expressed an approval upon the
ground that they &#8220;must win by Hook-<i>er</i> by Crook&#8221;
(hook or by crook).</p>


<h3><i>Cut Cavendish.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> being interrogated why Americans used so
much tobacco, Abe replied &#8220;because they <i>chews</i>&#8221;
(choose).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Commodore Wilks.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the president heard of the capture of
Slidell and Mason on board the <i>Trent</i>, he foresaw
that it would be likely to breed a rupture
with England, but dismissed the consideration of
it by saying that &#8220;should the commander&#8217;s foolish
conduct place him in difficulties, he would not fail
to give Wilks a <i>hoister</i> (an oyster).&#8221; On another
occasion in alluding to the same personage and
affair, he remarked that &#8220;it would serve <i>Wilks</i>
right if he lost his <i>place</i>&#8221; (plaice).</p>


<h3><i>A proper Cognomen.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Captain Frye, the son of Canon Frye, was,
for his distinguished bravery at the Battle of Bull&#8217;s
Run, jokingly alluded to by Sumner as a son of a
gun. Old Abe remarked that &#8220;he could with far
greater propriety call him a son of a <i>Canon</i>&#8221;
(cannon).</p>


<h3><i>A Princely Pun.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> hearing that our Prince, Alfred, had declined
to become King of the Greeks, Abraham remarked
that &#8220;the reason he did not mount the
throne of Greece was because he preferred his
own native <i>isle</i>&#8221; (oil).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>A Severe Retort.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">General</span> Grant once applied for permission to be
employed in a special service on the ground that
he commanded none but tried men. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied
the president, &#8220;I admit the truthfulness of your
plea, for if they have not been tried in the field
they have been <i>tried</i> elsewhere!&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Conundrum.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Come,</span> Chase,&#8221; said Lincoln, on one occasion
while sitting <i>tete-a-tete</i> with the great American
financier, &#8220;I will give you a conundrum: Why is
a man who deals in stale jokes like a stock-jobber?&#8221;
After sundry ineffectual attempts upon the part
of his friend to find an answer, the presidential
joker gave the following for a reply: &#8220;Because
he deals in <i>fun dead</i> (funded) property.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>A Grumbler Answered.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> well-known American grumbler once
appeared before the president to obtain the dismissal
of General Grant upon the ground of
drunkenness. &#8220;Why,&#8221; exclaimed the faultfinder,
&#8220;he, on one occasion, drank twelve bottles of wine
at a sitting.&#8221; &#8220;That,&#8221; said Lincoln, &#8220;is more
than I can swallow.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Loquacity.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A very</span> loquacious personage once applied for a
government situation upon the ground that he had
no other mode of obtaining a living, having tried
several shops and failed at each! &#8220;I cannot grant
your request,&#8221; was the president&#8217;s reply, &#8220;but I
would suggest that you tried a <i>tongue</i> shop.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>A Slashing Inuendo.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> President Lincoln visited the army of the
Potomac, a captain with a face cut and slashed in
all directions, complained of the great want of
ambulances and the consequent sufferings of the
wounded. &#8220;I will do my best,&#8221; replied Abe, &#8220;to
supply the deficiency,&#8221; and then, turning to another,
he remarked that &#8220;the captain had no right to complain
of the number of his (s) cars.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Scriptural Criticism.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Abe</span> Lincoln, who is by no means a bad judge of
paintings, was shewn a picture done by a very indifferent
hand, and asked to give an opinion of it.
&#8220;Why,&#8221; said the president, the &#8220;painter is a very
good painter, and observes the Lord&#8217;s commandments.&#8221;
&#8220;What do you mean by that, Mr. Lincoln?&#8221;
said a well-known member of the senate, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
standing by. &#8220;Why, I think,&#8221; answered Abraham,
&#8220;that he hath not made to himself the likeness of
anything that is in the heaven above, or that is
in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under
the earth.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>A Poultry (paltry) War.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A crony</span> of Abe&#8217;s&mdash;a man named Payne, was
appointed a general at Illinois; in reference to
his election the following is recorded, which the
president tells with great <i>gusto</i>: One day a
wealthy old lady, whose plantation was in
the vicinity of the camp, came in and inquired for
General Payne. When the commander made his
appearance, the old lady in warm language told
him that his men had stolen her last coop of
chickens, and demanded its restoration or its value
in money. &#8220;I am sorry for you, madam,&#8221;
replied the general, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t help it.
The fact is, Madam, we are determined to squelch
out the rebellion, if it cost every d&mdash;&mdash;d
chicken in Tennessee.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Lincoln on Physic.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lincoln</span> once said of an apothecary, that his
employment was to pour drugs, of which he knew
little, into a body of which he knew less.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>False Accusation.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> General Peck attempted to take Blackwater,
in Virginia, fear was expressed, that from his known
sternness, he would compromise the honour
of the Federal cause by giving the place up to
pillage. &#8220;No fear,&#8221; said Lincoln, &#8220;it takes
more <i>pecks</i> than one to make a <i>sack</i>.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>How to make Foes.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;When</span> I give away a place,&#8221; said Lincoln, to a
person who was continually importuning him, &#8220;I
discover that I always make a hundred foes to
one friend.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Tough Job.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Constant</span> practice as a rail-splitter,&#8221; said Lincoln
&#8220;gave me a thorough knowledge of the various
grain found in wood, but I never thought ebony
would be so tough to work upon, as I have found
it to be since I took to dealing with these
d&mdash;d niggers.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>The only alternative.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;How</span> shall we get cotton&#8221; said a northern manufacturer
to the president. &#8220;Well, I suppose you
must just wait till the southerners <i>get worsted</i>,&#8221;
was Abe&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Abe&#8217;s Difficulties.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A celebrated</span> American Explorer, while chatting
with the president, said that in his late attempt
to discover the remains of the unfortunate Sir
John Franklin and his crew, he passed through
Davis&#8217;-straits. &#8220;Did you, by God,&#8221; said Abe,
&#8220;then, I should think you are the only person on
earth who could pass through mine.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Misnomers.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;What</span> are you?&#8221; said Lincoln, to a man dressed in
fustian, who rudely accosted him in the streets of
Washington. &#8220;I am a civil engineer&#8221; was the
reply. &#8220;Then,&#8221; said the president, &#8220;you are
like the war now raging, sadly mis-named, for there
is nothing civil about you.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Deficiency of Fuel.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A ship</span> was lately dispatched by Welles to endeavour
to capture the celebrated Southern cruiser, yclept
the <i>Alabama</i>. After the ship had been absent a
short time it was discovered that the supply of
coals was deficient. The coals had been supplied
by a celebrated New York dealer in that commodity
named Heaven. Upon the matter being mentioned
to Lincoln, he replied, &#8220;Well, he ought to have
telegraphed to <i>Heaven</i> for more coals.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>A Queer Compliment.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Lincoln sent Admiral &mdash;&mdash; to enforce
the blockade at Charlestown and Wellington, he
said &#8220;there was no chance of failure, as the person
sent carried with him a <i>blockhead</i> that nothing
could penetrate.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>A slight addition.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A New</span> York lawyer was desirous of being appointed
as a judge. &#8220;There are only ten,&#8221; he exclaimed,
&#8220;to transact the whole of the state&#8217;s
affairs.&#8221; &#8220;And so you want to increase them to
one hundred,&#8221; said Lincoln. &#8220;How so,&#8221; said the
applicant. &#8220;Why, by adding a cipher to them.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Preaching out West.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lincoln</span> is very fond of repeating the following:
&#8220;I knew an old preacher, out west, who, on a very
cold day, when describing hell, said &#8216;it was an
awful place and that the cold was unbearable.&#8217;
One of his congregation, at the close of the sermon,
took upon himself to ask the preacher why
he had described hell as being cold, when all
eminent divines said it was the very reverse. &#8216;Oh,
sir,&#8217; said the preacher, &#8216;I had good reason, for if
I had preached the reverse, I should have had
them running away to warm themselves.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Tom Thumb.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;I understand</span>, General,&#8221; said Lincoln, addressing
the celebrated dwarf, Tom Thumb,
&#8220;that you are about to have the first instalment of
a family.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the general&#8217;s reply.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the president, &#8220;I trust it will be a
boy.&#8221; &#8220;Why,&#8221; interrogated the dwarf. &#8220;Because
I should like your infant to increase my infantry.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>How a Black&#8217;s Made.</i></h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">&#8220;I tell</span> you,&#8221; said Seward to Lincoln, one day,</div>
<div class="indent">&#8220;Everything you proclaim is quite right,</div>
<div class="verse">But to arm the poor nigger is not quite the thing,</div>
<div class="indent">For two blacks never yet made a white.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;You are wrong, they are equal, no matter their hue,</div>
<div class="indent">And I&#8217;ll prove that in judgment you lack:</div>
<div class="verse">Only give me your help, and united I&#8217;ll prove,</div>
<div class="indent">That two <i>whites</i> can at least make a <i>black</i>.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;My service you claim, and freely &#8217;tis given;</div>
<div class="indent">Now, the truth of your promise let&#8217;s see.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">He wrote, &#8220;manumission,&#8221; then cried, &#8220;It is done:</div>
<div class="indent"><i>For a black&#8217;s never made till he&#8217;s free!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>


<h3><i>Abe&#8217;s First Joke.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Abe</span> Lincoln, when a boy, had an uncle who kept
a mill down west. Noticing that the mill was
going very slow, the young joker, on meeting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
miller, said, he could eat the meal faster than the
mill ground it. &#8220;How long could you do so?&#8221; said
his uncle, struck by the boy&#8217;s remark. &#8220;Why,
&#8217;till I <i>starved to death</i>,&#8221; replied the young incorrigible.</p>


<h3><i>A Wonderful Child.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;American</span> babies,&#8221; said Lincoln, during the
time of the celebrated baby show, &#8220;lick all babies.
I have seen one in Massachusetts, only six
months old, sitting in its mother&#8217;s lap, viewing its
own cradle, to see if it could not invent a better,
or, at least, suggest some improvement.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>How to stop thieves.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Friend</span> Lincoln,&#8221; said a celebrated Western
farmer, one day, to the president, &#8220;thee knows almost
everything; can thee tell me how I am to
preserve my small beer in the back yard? My
neighbours are often tapping it of nights.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Put
a barrel of old Madeira by the side of it, let the
rogues but get a taste of that, and I warrant they&#8217;ll
never touch your small beer any more.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Hopping the twig.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;It</span> is no use, president; wherever I go,&#8221; said an
officer appointed to enforce the draft, &#8220;I find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
houses shut up, and the bird flown.&#8221; &#8220;I see,&#8221;
said the president, &#8220;they are <i>afraid of the draft</i>.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>The best saddles.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a dispute at Washington about which
were the best saddles for the Federal Cavalry.
Lincoln said &#8220;the best saddles were decidedly
saddles of mutton.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>An offer rejected.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Blondin was performing his daring feats at
Niagara, he asked Lincoln &#8220;if he would mind
trusting himself on his back.&#8221; The answer was
somewhat prophetic, and as follows: &#8220;I shall not
trust your rope!&#8221; (Europe).</p>


<h3><i>A decided smasher.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;That</span> paper must be rigorously dealt with,&#8221;
said Welles. &#8220;I have already,&#8221; said Lincoln
&#8220;contrived to divide America, and you now want
me to smash the <i>Globe</i>!&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Artillery Practice.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> is was reported that General Blunt had let
the rebel cavalry escape. The President remarked
to the Chief of the War Department, that &#8220;the
appointment of such a man was a piece of folly,
for how could it be expected that <i>Blunt</i> could be
<i>Sharp</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>A curious addition.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Is</span> it not curious, General,&#8221; said Abe to McClellan,
&#8220;that whenever a piece of field artillery is fired,
that the number of animals attending it is increased?&#8221;
&#8220;How so?&#8221; said the famous Northern General.
&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Lincoln, &#8220;it then has not only its
four horses in front, but it has also <i>its moke</i>
behind.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>The Cost of War.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Your</span> fighting, General,&#8221; said Lincoln, to a
general who had returned disabled, &#8220;has been an
expensive affair to you.&#8221; &#8220;How so&#8221; &#8220;Why,&#8221;
said the president, &#8220;it has cost you a <i>leg I see</i>&#8221;
(legacy.)</p>


<h3><i>In memory of.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> commemorate the battle of Bull&#8217;s run, the
Yankees are about to build an hotel there. On
hearing of this, Lincoln remarked that &#8220;there was
a <i>hot hell</i> there before.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>A Crocodile&#8217;s age.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Abe</span> Lincoln prides himself on being the first to
make known the means of ascertaining the age of
crocodiles. He says that a negro acquainted him
with the fact that a sort of bag is placed in the intestines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of the crocodiles, which always contains a
number of stones corresponding with the years of
its life, it being the custom of these animals to
swallow a stone on their birthday.</p>


<h3><i>No Thanks.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Abe,</span> at one of his morning levees, had a visitor
who introduced himself as one of the President&#8217;s
best friends, and soliciting a government post then
vacant as the gift of Abe, urged his claim for the
appointment upon the ground that it was solely
through the applicant&#8217;s exertions Mr. Lincoln was
elected president. &#8220;Oh, indeed;&#8221; said Abe,
&#8220;I now look upon the man, who of all men, has
crowned my existence with a crown of thorns&mdash;no
post for you in my gift, I assure you; I wish you
good morning.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Merry-Making.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Merrimac was about to be christened.
The president remarked, &#8220;that it was a somewhat
strange <i>title</i> as the ship was built, to make
mourning rather than <i>make merry</i>.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>A Husband&#8217;s Wit.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L&mdash;</span> was, one day, engaged in making an
apple pie, and in the operation contrived to besmear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
her face with the <i>batter</i>. The president observing
the same, asked her &#8220;the loan of her <i>batter
eye</i>&#8221; (battery).</p>


<h3><i>The cause discovered.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Federals flew before the Southerners at
Bull&#8217;s run. Lincoln remarked that &#8220;it resulted
from the army having <i>too many wings</i>.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Byronic.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lincoln,</span> upon hearing that an old friend of his
had gone to Utah, said &#8220;he supposed he had gone
to spend his <i>latter days</i> among the <i>Mormon
knights</i>.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>A satisfactory conclusion.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Lincoln read the account of Bull&#8217;s run,
wherein it said that the Northern army was
knocked into a cocked hat. Lincoln drily remarked
that &#8220;he supposed it had been caught
<i>napping</i>.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>A mother&#8217;s alarm.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A lady</span> was lamenting to the president that her
only son had gone to the war, and asked him
what she had better do. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;you
can&#8217;t do better than buy him <i>a life preserver</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Punning again.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Governor</span> Seymour telegraphed to Lincoln
during the late riots in New York City, that there
was no occasion to act so harshly and drag so many
citizens off to prison. The reply was that &#8220;he
(the president) thought quite differently, and that
he should never be content till he&#8217;d <i>see more</i> (Seymour)
there.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Idol.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;There</span> you are,&#8221; said Mrs. Lincoln one day to
her husband&mdash;at your idol again&mdash;alluding to his
well-known love of tobacco. &#8220;Yes, my dear,&#8221; was
his reply, &#8220;<i>I am burning it.</i>&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>A Word for the Irish.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A lieutenant</span> told the president that of all the
men that composed his regiment, the Irish gave him
the greatest amount of uneasiness. &#8220;Sir,&#8221; was
Lincoln&#8217;s reply, &#8220;our enemies, the rebels, make the
same complaint.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Skill of a Young Officer.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">McClellan</span> was once speaking to the President
of a promising young officer who was slain at the
cattle of Bull&#8217;s run. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the American
Chief, &#8220;if there was doubt about his being skilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
while living, no one doubts but that <i>he&#8217;s</i> (s) <i>killed</i>
now.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>A foot in it.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Admiral Foote was appointed to command
the South Atlantic squadron, he bade
Welles to see that the Admiral&#8217;s ship was quite
sea-worthy. &#8220;How is it you are so particular,&#8221;
said the Naval Chief. &#8220;Why,&#8221; said Lincoln, with
a chuckle, &#8220;have I not placed my <i>Foot</i> in it.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Lincoln to Ewell</i>,</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">On his not forcing Hill to cross
the Potomac.</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">&#8220;Dear</span> Ewell,&#8221; wrote Lincoln, one day in a pet,</div>
<div class="indent">&#8220;Your tactics have ended in loss;</div>
<div class="verse">You have let Hill escape, I will venture to bet,</div>
<div class="indent">It&#8217;s <i>myself</i> and not him you made <i>cross</i>.</div>
<div class="verse">Why were you so blinded by Hill&#8217;s little <i>ruse</i>?</div>

<div class="verse">Your failures, disasters, really give one the blues,</div>
<div class="indent">And I wish I could only make <i>you Hill</i>&#8221; (you ill).</div>
</div></div>


<h3><i>Shakspearian Query.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Abraham</span> is known to be very fond of Shakspeare,
yet at times, to indulge in a joke, even at
the expense of his favourite. A short time since,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
he wrote as follows to a popular actor, with whom
he is known to be on intimate terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;In <i>Hamlet</i>, Act II., Scene 2, is this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>King.</i> He tells me, my dear Gertrude,
he hath found the head and source of all your
son&#8217;s distemper.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Queen.</i> I doubt it is no other but the
<i>main</i>.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, does her Majesty imply that <i>Hamlet</i>
suffered from sea-sickness?&#8221;</p>

<p>The reply was that the actor believed that it was
not the <i>main</i> cause.</p>


<h3><i>Running Comment.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> hearing that an American composer was engaged
in writing a national hymn&mdash;&mdash;, the President
hinted that &#8220;He hoped that it would not
have too many <i>runs</i> in it.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>An Impossibility.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;The</span> Americans,&#8221; said Chase, &#8220;at the present
crisis, must not be extravagant&mdash;they must live
<i>under</i> their incomes.&#8221; &#8220;How can they do that,&#8221;
said the President, &#8220;when there is no alternative
but their living <i>on</i> them.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Jack&#8217;s Opinion.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> President narrates the following story:&mdash;&#8220;While
passing along the streets of New York,
one day, I met a Jack Tar. &#8216;What ship,&#8217; I enquired,
&#8216;do you belong to?&#8217; &#8216;What odds is that
to you,&#8217; was the reply. &#8216;Do you know who I
am,&#8217; I exclaimed. &#8216;No.&#8217; &#8216;Why, I am the President.&#8217;
Then, said Jack, &#8216;<i>You have a damned
good berth of it!</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>The House of Congress.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;That</span> house,&#8221; said Abe, &#8220;is a swan house&mdash;all
white and fair outside, but only think of the black-legs
that are working out of sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>[This, if ever said by the President, is an
adaptation from Douglas Jerrold.]</p>


<h3><i>Abe Lincoln&#8217;s opinion of a man&#8217;s strength.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> the receipt of the news that &mdash;&mdash; had carried
Fort Nagher&mdash;the President drily remarked
that &#8220;He must be a very <i>strong man</i>!&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>The Fall of Pride.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> enthusiastic Englishman once said to the
President, that the Niagara river was the pride of
rivers. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;but that pride has
a tremendous fall.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>The Captain&#8217;s Reply.</i></h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">&#8220;We&#8217;re</span> short of prog, said Captain B&mdash;&mdash;,</div>
<div class="indent">When going on a trip;</div>
<div class="verse">And as we&#8217;ve little got to eat,</div>
<div class="indent">We&#8217;ll dine off the ship.</div>
<div class="verse">Fear not, but keep your powder dry,</div>
<div class="indent">And place faith in the Lord;</div>
<div class="verse">You&#8217;ve naught to fear, for seamen cooks</div>
<div class="indent">Can always cook a-board.</div>
<div class="verse">The captain quickly did reply,</div>
<div class="indent">While standing by the wheel,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Tis little, Abe&#8217;rm, that we have&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">How can we cook <i>a deal</i>.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>


<h3><i>A Strange Similarity.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Why</span> is the Northern army,&#8221; asked the President,
&#8220;like the post-office at Washington?&#8221;
&#8220;Because it is made up of columns, wings, and
squares, and, judging from the past, it is also
<i>doomed</i>.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Economy.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;There</span> is no nonsense about these sardines,&#8221; said
Mrs. Lincoln, &#8220;they are genuine, and came from
the Mediterranean.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Lincoln, &#8220;and
if you leave them to themselves <i>they will go a great
deal farther</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Where Punch got his Cartoon from.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Lincoln sent contributions to the Northern
army, he wrote to General &mdash;&mdash; as follows:&mdash;&#8220;Dear
Sir,&mdash;Knowing that the army under your
charge requires purging, I herewith send you a
<i>black draft</i>.&#8221;&mdash;Yours, Lincoln.</p>


<h3><i>Pun upon Pun.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> facetious president thus wrote to a friend in
Scotland:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;As however, I am somewhat partial to female
authors (Scotch or otherwise), don&#8217;t forget to remember
me to all the <i>blue belles</i> of Scotland, and
to as many <i>primroses</i> as you can find. The remembrance
may produce a little <i>heart&#8217;s ease</i>, and
cause their <i>two-lips</i> to bless you.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Lincoln at the Play.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> the pleasure on Monday night of seeing
&#8220;Macbeth&#8221; rendered upon the stage of Messrs. Wallack
and Devonport, and also of seeing Mr. Lincoln
present at the same time. It is Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s
favourite play, and one could not repress a certain
curiosity to know (though he is familiar with them
as he is with stump speaking, doubtless) how certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
passages would strike him. When the following
passage between Malcolm and Macduff was
pronounced the audience was suddenly silent as the
grave:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
<i>Mal.</i>&mdash;Let me seek out some desolate shade,</div>
<div class="verse">and there weep our bosoms empty.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Macd.</i>            <span class="gap"> Let us rather</span></div>
<div class="verse">Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men</div>
<div class="verse">Bestride our downfall&#8217;n birthdom. Each new morn</div>
<div class="verse">New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows</div>
<div class="verse">Strike on the face of heaven, that it resounds</div>
<div class="verse">As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out</div>
<div class="verse">Like syllable of dolour.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mr. Lincoln leaned back in his chair in the shade
after this sentence was pronounced, and for a long
time wore a sad, sober face, as if suddenly his
thoughts had wandered from the playroom far
away to where his great armies contest with the rebellious
of a vast empire.</p>


<h3><i>A Ludicrous Mistake.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Who</span> has been guilty of these crimes,&#8221; said
Lincoln, alluding to those committed by New
York electioneering agents, &#8220;Donohue,&#8221; was the
reply. &#8220;Then learn out as speedily as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>A Southern Estimate.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> informed that General Stoughton had
been captured by the rebels at Fairfax, the President
is reported to have said that he did not mind
the loss of the Brigadier as much as he did the
loss of the horses. &#8220;For,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I can make
a much better Brigadier in five minutes, but
the horses cost a hundred and twenty-five dollars
a-piece.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Strong Habits.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Well,&#8221;</span> said the President, after the last repulse
before Richmond, &#8220;them blessed &#8216;babies&#8217;
do fight, and the old chaps lifted from their
graves are at any rate from the right <i>mould</i>;
the babies are like young puppies that can stand
a deal of licking, and the old boys are too old
to <i>run</i>!&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>How to Fight.</i></h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">&#8220;Those</span> Southerners fight! its all blarney,&#8221; said Abe;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Put your swords in your sheath, boys, and lick Hills;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;But a man without a sword is at fighting a babe</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Then, damn-me, said Abe, use your <i>Sickles</i>!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>A Majority Wanted.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> it was reported to Abe Lincoln that the
men engaged in the coal pits had refused to fight the
old joker said, &#8220;He didn&#8217;t expect miners (minors)
to fight;&#8221; &#8220;but stay,&#8221; said Lincoln, &#8220;is there no
way of making Majors of these minors?&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>A Story concerning a Second Term.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is said that, some time ago, a gentleman hinted
to the President that it was deemed quite settled
that he would accept a re-nomination for his present
office, whereupon Mr. Lincoln was reminded
of a story of Jesse Dubois, out in Illinois. Jesse
as State Auditor, had charge of the State House
at Springfield. An itinerant preacher came along
and asked the use of it for a lecture.</p>

<p>&#8220;On what subject?&#8221; asked Jesse.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the second coming of our Saviour,&#8221; answered
the long-faced Millerite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, bosh,&#8221; retorted Uncle Jesse, testily; &#8220;I
guess if our Saviour had ever been to Springfield,
and had got away with his life, he&#8217;d be too smart
to think of coming back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>This, Mr. Lincoln said, was very much his case
about the succession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Estimate of Official Honours.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> a further elucidation of Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s estimation
of Presidential honours, a story is told of
how a supplicant for office of more than ordinary
pretensions called upon him, and, presuming on
the activity he had shown in behalf of the Republican
ticket, asserted, as a reason why the office
should be given to him, that he had made Mr.
Lincoln president.</p>

<p>&#8220;You made me President, did you?&#8221; said Mr.
Lincoln, with a twinkle of his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I did,&#8221; said the applicant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then a precious mess you&#8217;ve got me into,
that&#8217;s all,&#8221; replied the President, and closed the
discussion.</p>


<h3><i>Truly Awful.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;When</span> do you think this war will be ended,
Mr. Lincoln?&#8221; said an impatient citizen. &#8220;Why,
when we have whipped the slaveowners.&#8221;
&#8220;Then I&#8217;m thinking,&#8221; replied the citizen, &#8220;that
you will never live to see its close. I have
already seen its clothes, and they are the most blood-stained
and bespattered lot I ever saw. But I
<i>trow</i>, sir, war is sure to spoil the <i>habits</i> of a
people, especially when they go to sleep in
breeches.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Presidential Puns.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> it was told to Lincoln that a division
of Burnside&#8217;s had been entrapped into a <i>cul de
sac</i>, Lincoln <i>said</i> he&#8217;d cull the <i>sack</i> for his stupidity.</p>


<h3><i>A Liberal Giver.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span>, in his happier moments, is not
always reminded of a &#8220;little story,&#8221; but often
indulges in a veritable joke. One of the latest
reported is his remark when he found himself attacked
by the varioloid; he had been recently
very much worried by people asking favours.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, when the contagious disease
was coming upon him, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got something now
that I can give to everybody.&#8221; About the time
when there was considerable grumbling as to the
delay in forwarding to the troops the money due
to them, a western paymaster, in full major&#8217;s attire,
was one day introduced at a public reception.
&#8220;Being here, Mr. Lincoln,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I thought
I&#8217;d call and pay my respects.&#8221; &#8220;From the complaints
of the soldiers,&#8221; responded the President,
&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s about all any of you can pay.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Coffee versus Tea.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is told by a Federal correspondent, who is
probably &#8220;reliable,&#8221; that Mr. Lincoln was walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
up Pennsylvania Avenue the other day, relating
&#8220;a little story&#8221; to Secretary Seward, when the
latter called his attention to a new sign bearing
the name of &#8220;T. R. Strong.&#8221; &#8220;Ha!&#8221; says old Abe,
his countenance lighting up with a peculiar smile,
&#8220;T. R. Strong, but coffee are stronger.&#8221; Seward
smiled, but made no reply. [We don&#8217;t see how he
could reply after so atrocious a thing as that.]</p>

<h3><i>Miraculous.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> brothers named Fish were drafted in the
city of New York, out of Twenty Seven-street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
The facetious Abe hearing this, at once declared it
to be &#8220;A most miraculous draught of <i>fishes</i>.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Liquor, Boys.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A number</span> of clergymen of the Beecher school
waited on the President with a memorial, signed
by 7,000 religious Presbyterians, requesting that
General Grant be removed on the ground of
drunkenness. They got a warm reception from
Old Abe for their pains, who retorted thus: &#8220;Only
tell me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;where he buys his liquor, I will
be obliged to you, and will send a cask of the
same liquor to every general in the army.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Seasonable.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Alluding</span> to one of the great battles recently
fought, the President, in bidding farewell to the
general said, &#8220;I hear that the rebels complain of a
want of salt, I hope when you return you will be
able to inform me that after you have as-(<i>sault</i>)ed
them they will have been sufficiently peppered.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Too Deep.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> President at a dinner party related the following
with much gusto: &#8220;During one of the retreats
of the Army of the Potomac, some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
cavalry had a desire to cross, the commanding
officer called out to them to &#8216;form <i>two deep</i>.&#8217;
One of them, however, in advance of the rest, and
up to his horse&#8217;s nose in water, called out that he
was &#8216;too deep already.&#8217;&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>How to Conquer the South.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> kind words the President said regarding
the enemy, called forth a rebuke from an elderly
lady who was present. She wondered how he
could speak kindly of his enemies, when he
should rather destroy them. &#8220;What, madam?&#8221;
replied the President, &#8220;do I not destroy them
when I make them my friends?&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Gratuitous Kindness.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> President Lincoln was a very young man,
he paid a visit to New York. While there, some
thief contrived to ease him of his watch. The
next day the young joker inserted the following
in the <i>New York Herald</i>: &#8220;Stolen, a watch
worth a hundred dollars. If the thief will return
it, he shall be informed, gratis, where he may
steal one worth two of it, and no questions asked.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Blowing Hot and Cold.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;It&#8217;s</span> very hot in the south, Mr. Lincoln, is it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
not?&#8221; said a personal friend to Lincoln, on his
return from a visit to an important station of the
Federal army. &#8220;Very,&#8221; was the ready answer,
&#8220;I saw a woman do her ironing with no other
warming power save that of the sunshine, and as
I came away she was hanging her kettle out of
the window to get her tea ready.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Negro Pluck.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Mrs. Lincoln doubting the heroism of the
niggers, her husband related the following:&mdash;&#8220;A
negro at Boston had a severe attack of rheumatism,
which finally settled in his foot. He
bathed it and rubbed it, but to no purpose. Finally,
tearing the bandage off, he stuck it out with a
savage grin, and shaking his fist at it, exclaimed,
&#8216;Ache away, dear old feller, I shan&#8217;t do nothing
more for yer; dis child,&#8217; tapping his breast, &#8216;can
stand it as long as you can, so ache away.&#8217;&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Hirsute Philosophy.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;For</span> a military man,&#8221; said a conceited coxcomb,
to Abe one day, &#8220;don&#8217;t you think moustaches
becoming?&#8221; &#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; was Abe&#8217;s reply,
&#8220;they may <i>be coming</i>, but haven&#8217;t yet arrived.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Slander.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;It,&#8221;</span> said the conductor of State Affairs in
America, &#8220;would be a perpetual flea hunt if one
were obliged to run down all the inuendoes, the
inveracities, the insinuations, the suspicions, &amp;c.,
uttered against him.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Change of Climate.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> President of America, while taking a stroll
along the wharfs of Boston, U. S., met a tall,
gaunt-looking figure, a &#8220;digger,&#8221; from California,
and got into conversation with him. &#8220;Healthy
climate, I suppose?&#8221; &#8220;Healthy! it ain&#8217;t anything
else. Why, stranger, you can choose there
any climate you like, hot or cold, and that without
travellin&#8217; more than fifteen minutes. Jest think
o&#8217; that the next cold morning when you get out
o&#8217; bed. There&#8217;s a mountain there&mdash;the Sawyer
Navaday, they call it&mdash;with a valley on each side
of it, the one hot, and t&#8217;other cold. Well, get
on the top of that mountain with a double-barrelled
gun, and you can, without movin&#8217;, kill
either summer or winter game, jest as you will.&#8221;
&#8220;What! have you ever tried it?&#8221; &#8220;Tried it!
often, and should have done pretty well, but for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
one thing.&#8221; &#8220;Well, what was that?&#8221; &#8220;I wanted
a dog that would <i>stand both climates</i>. The last
dog I had <i>froze off his tail</i> while pintin&#8217; on the
summer side. He didn&#8217;t get entirely out of the
winter side, you see&mdash;trew as you live.&#8221; Abe
sloped.</p>


<h3><i>Cruel News.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Admiral Farragut</span> said that his ship was a first
rate vessel, but <i>its crew</i> was somewhat ailing.
The President immediately ordered a new crew
and told poor Farragut to keep his &#8220;<i>cruel</i>&#8221; (crew
ill news) to himself for the future.</p>


<h3><i>Lincoln&#8217;s opinion of Mr. Curtain.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Curtain was put forth as the Republican
Candidate for Pennsylvania, the President said,
&#8220;he believed that <i>Curtin</i> to be nothing more
than a <i>Blind</i>.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>A new Motive Power.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A grand</span> mistake was made in the construction
of one of the Federal rams, there being insufficient
space for stowing the fuel. Upon hearing
this he blamed the constructor, and asked him
if he intended the vessel to be driven by the <i>force
of circumstances</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Southern Hills versus Northern Banks.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Banks</span> is a good general,&#8221; said Sumpter to the
President, on a recent occasion. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the
reply, &#8220;but our Northern <i>Banks</i> are not equal
to the Southern <i>Hills</i>.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>The President and the Pleader.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> being hinted to a western pleader that he
ought to bring his defence to a close; he answered,
&#8220;that he would speak as long as he
pleased.&#8221; &#8220;You have spoken longer than you
<i>please</i>,&#8221; said Lincoln, who was standing by his
side.</p>


<h3><i>Waterproof.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;What</span> horrid weather, President,&#8221; said a tall
rawboned Yankee. &#8220;It is; I thought I had
altered the condition of your <i>cly</i>-mate,&#8221; said the
President, winking.</p>


<h3><i>Concerning Congress Men.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is stated that he was much disgusted at the
crowd of officers who some time ago used to loiter
about the Washington hotels, and he is reported
to have remarked to a member of Congress;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
&#8220;These fellows <i>and the Congress men</i> do vex me
sorely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another member of Congress was conversing
with the President, and was somewhat annoyed
by the President&#8217;s propensity to divert attention
from the serious object he had on his mind, by
ludicrous allusions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lincoln,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I think you would
have your joke if you were within a mile of hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the President, &#8220;that is about the
distance to the Capitol.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Inquisitiveness Nonplussed.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span> has a very effective way sometimes
of dealing with men who trouble him with questions.
Somebody asked him how many men the
rebels had in the field. He replied very seriously,
&#8220;Twelve hundred thousand, according to the best
authority.&#8221;</p>

<p>The interrogator blanched in the face, and
ejaculated, &#8220;My God!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, twelve hundred thousand&mdash;no doubt
of it. You see, all of our Generals, when they
get whipped, say the enemy outnumbers them
from three or five to one, and I must believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
them; we have four hundred thousand men in
the field, and three times four make twelve; don&#8217;t
you see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The inquisitive man looked for his hat soon after
&#8220;seeing it.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>The Judge and his Coachman.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day, when Mr. Bates was remonstrating
with Mr. Lincoln against the appointment of
some indifferent lawyer to a place of judicial importance,
the President interposed with, &#8220;Come,
now, Bates, he&#8217;s not half so bad as you think.
Besides that, I must tell you, he did me a good
turn long ago. When I took to the law, I was
going to court one morning, with some ten or
twelve miles of bad made road before me, and I
had no horse. The judge overtook me in his
waggon. &#8216;Hello, Lincoln, are you not going to
the court-house? Come in, and I&#8217;ll give you a
seat.&#8217; Well, I got in, and the judge went on
reading his papers. Presently the waggon struck
a stump on one side of the road; then it hopped
off to the other. I looked out, and I saw the
driver was jerking from side to side in his seat, so,
says I, &#8216;Judge, I think your coachman has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
taking a little drop too much this morning.&#8217;
&#8216;Well, I declare, Lincoln,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I should not
much wonder if you were right, for he has nearly
upset me half-a-dozen times since starting.&#8217; So,
putting his head out of the window, he shouted,
&#8216;Why, you infernal scoundrel, you are drunk!&#8217;
Upon which, pulling up his horses, and turning
round with great gravity, the coachman said&mdash;&#8216;By
gorra! that&#8217;s the first rightful decision you
have given for the last twelvemonth.&#8217;&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Concerning the President Personally.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> one was smoking in the presence of the
President, and complimented him on having no
vices, neither drinking nor smoking.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a doubtful compliment,&#8221; answered
the President, &#8220;I recollect once being outside a
stage in Illinois, and a man sitting by me offered
me a segar. I told him I had no vices. He said
nothing, smoked for some time, and then grunted
out, &#8216;It&#8217;s my experience that folks who have no
vices have plagued few virtues.&#8217;&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>The President&#8217;s Vanity.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> Abe is rather vain of his height, but one day
a young man called on him who was certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
three inches taller than the former; he was like
the mathematical definition of the straight line&mdash;length
without breadth. &#8220;Really,&#8221; said old Abe,
&#8220;I must look up to you; if you ever get in a deep
place you ought to be able to wade out.&#8221; That
reminds us of the story told of Lincoln, when
called from an hotel. He at once obeyed the
command of the assembled Yankees, with his wife
(somewhat below medium height), and made the
following quizzical remarks: &#8220;Here I am, and here
is Mrs. Lincoln. That&#8217;s the <i>long</i> and <i>short</i> of it.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Tremendous answer.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;How</span> old is that tree, Abe?&#8221; said a friend of the
now President, when the latter was engaged in the
occupation of rail-splitting. &#8220;Well, I am not
sure; but I am just about to <i>axe</i> him.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Two instances where the President was not
reminded of a story.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> President is often naturally bantered about
his habit of story-telling.</p>

<p>Dr. Hovey, of Dansville, N.Y., called at the
White House, and found the occupant on horseback,
ready for a ride. The Dr. approached and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
said: &#8220;Lincoln, I thought I would call and see
you before leaving the city, and hear you tell a
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lincoln greeted him pleasantly, and asked him
where he was from.</p>

<p>The reply was: &#8220;From Western New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a good enough country without
stories,&#8221; said the President, and off he rode.</p>


<h3><i>Public Opinion.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> moral philosopher was telling the old President
one day about the undercurrent of public
opinion; he went on to explain it at length, and
drew an illustration from the Mediterranean Sea.
The current seemed very curiously to flow in both
from the Black Sea and the Atlantic Ocean; but
a shrewd Yankee, by means of a contrivance of
floats, had discovered that in the outlet into the
Atlantic only about thirty feet of the surface
water flowed inward, while there was a tremendous
current under that flowing out. &#8220;That,&#8221;
said Mr. Lincoln, much bored, &#8220;that don&#8217;t remind
me of any story I ever heard of.&#8221; The philosopher
despaired of making a serious impression by
his argument, and left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>The President&#8217;s Secret.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Sherman expedition, which captured
Fort Royal, was fitting out, there was great
curiosity to learn where it had gone. A person,
visiting the chief magistrate at the White House,
importuned him very much to disclose the destination
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you keep it entirely secret?&#8221; asked the
President.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, upon my honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the President, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221;
Assuming an air of great mystery, and drawing
the man close to him, he kept him a moment
awaiting title revelation with an open mouth and
great anxiety. &#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, in a loud whisper,
which was heard all over the room, &#8220;the
expedition has gone to&mdash;sea!&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>About the Negro Question.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> story will be remembered, perhaps, of Mr.
Lincoln&#8217;s reply to a Springfield (Ill.) clergyman,
who asked him what was to be his policy on the
slavery question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, your question is rather a good one, but
I will answer it by telling you a story. You know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Father B., the old Methodist preacher? and you
know Fox river and its freshets? Once in the
presence of Father B. a young Methodist was
worrying about Fox river, and expressing fears
that he should be prevented from fulfilling some
of his appointments by a freshet in the river.
Father B. checked him in the gravest manner.
Said he, &#8216;Young man, I have always made it a
rule in my life not to cross Fox river till I get to
it!&#8217; &#8216;And,&#8217; said old Abe, &#8216;I am not going to
worry myself over the slavery question till I get
to it!&#8217; Some few days afterwards a Methodist
minister called on the President, and on being
presented to him, said simply, &#8216;Mr. President, I
have come to tell you that I think we have got to
Fox river.&#8217; The old joker thanked the clergyman,
and laughed heartily.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>An extraordinary reply by Old Abe.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day, it is said, a distinguished New York
official was at Washington, and in an interview
with old Abe, introduced the question of emancipation.
&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Lincoln, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got to
be mighty cautious how we manage the negro
question; if we&#8217;re not, we may be like unto the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
barber out in Illinois, who was shaving a fellow
with hatchet face and lantern jaws like mine. The
barber put his finger in his customer&#8217;s mouth, to
make his cheek stick out, but while shaving away
he cut through the fellow&#8217;s cheek and cut off his
own finger! Now, if we don&#8217;t play smart about
the negro we shall do as the barber did.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>A Rebuke to people asking trivial questions.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A farmer,</span> not over patriotic, of the State of
Virginia, importuned the President to use his influence
to have a claim for damage done to his
farm by soldiers considered immediately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my dear sir,&#8221; replied Mr. Lincoln
blandly, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t think of such a thing; if I
considered individual cases, I should find work
enough for twenty Presidents!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said the persevering sufferer, &#8220;couldn&#8217;t
you just give me <i>a line</i> to Colonel &mdash;&mdash;
about it? <i>Just one line?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha, ha!&#8221; responded Old Abe, &#8220;you
remind me of old Jock Chase, out in Illinois.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this announcement the crowd huddled forward
to listen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Jock, I knew him like a brother&mdash;used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to be a lumberman on the Illinois, and he
was steady and sober, and the best raftsman on
the river. It was quite a trick twenty-five years
ago to take the logs over the rapids, but he was
skilful with a raft and always kept her straight in
the channel. Finally a steamboat was put on, and
Jock&mdash;he&#8217;s now dead, poor fellow!&mdash;was made a
captain of her. He was always used to take the
the wheel, going through the rapids. One day,
when the boat was plunging and wallowing along
the boiling current, and Jock&#8217;s utmost vigilance
was being exercised to keep her in the narrow
channel, a boy pulled his coat-tail and hailed him
with, &#8216;Stay, Mister Captain! I wish you&#8217;d jest
stop your boat a minute&mdash;<i>I have lost my apple
overboard!</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>A Liar.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;I don&#8217;t</span> believe him,&#8221; said Lincoln, on reading a
dispatch from one of his generals; &#8220;he is the
most notorious liar I ever knew. I have seen
him with lies swarming all around him as thick
as flies round a horse in autumn.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Strong Pills.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Those</span> pills of Brandredth&#8217;s,&#8221; said Abe, &#8220;are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
very powerful. I knew a man out west who used
to blast rocks with them; and, if thrown into the
crater of tna, they would stop the <i>bile</i>&#8221; (<i>boil</i>).</p>


<h3><i>A Sharp Rejoinder.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;How</span> beautiful,&#8221; said a poetical friend of the
President&#8217;s, who was noted for his disregard for
personal cleanliness, &#8220;is the face of Nature after
a shower.&#8221; &#8220;Aye,&#8221; said Abe, &#8220;and your&#8217;s would
look all the better for a wash!&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Wisdom at a Discount.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Have</span> you heard,&#8221; said Mrs. Lincoln, &#8220;that our
old friend, Mrs. Cobb, has been prosecuted for
bigamy?&#8221; &#8220;I have,&#8221; replied Lincoln, &#8220;and am
sorry for her, for her crime is that &#8216;She loved not
wisely but <i>two</i> well.&#8217;&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Pickles!</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Atlanta was destroyed a large quantity of
pickles were, inadvertently, destroyed. Lincoln
said, &#8220;It didn&#8217;t matter much, as his generals
generally contrived to get their men into no end
of <i>pickles</i>; but had they desired to have retained
them they surely ought to have been <i>preserved</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>A Conundrum.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Why,&#8221;</span> said the President, &#8220;is a Southern
Summer like the disunited States of America?&#8221;
His official friends gave it up. &#8220;Why,&#8221; said the
queerist, &#8220;because its cold (<i>gold</i>) is very difficult
to catch.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Over Early</i> v. <i>over late.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> it was made known to President Lincoln
that Sherman had gained a victory <i>over</i> Early he
said that it was a blessing to hear it, &#8220;as the victories
of the Federal generals were mostly <i>over
late</i>.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>The Poet and the President.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A poet</span> was in the habit of pestering the President
with his books. On one occasion he
brought one to the President, who told him to put
it into rhyme. He did so, and brought it back.
&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Abe, &#8220;it will do now; it is rhyme,
formerly it was neither rhyme nor reason.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Matrimony.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a mixed company which the President honored
with his presence, the topic of conversation turned
on matrimony, when one, as is usual, compared it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to Heaven, and another to Hell. On its being
referred to the President, he, like a philosopher as
he is, said &#8220;We had better take a middle course
and call it Purgatory.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Abe and the Picture Dealer.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A New York</span> picture dealer once applied to Abe
Lincoln to purchase, at a preposterously high
figure, a portrait, which he assured him was the
original of Wren, (Sir Christopher) by Hogarth.
Abe pretended to scan the picture closely, and
then cut the interview short by saying that it was
not a portrait of Wren; it looked more like robin
(<i>robbing</i>).</p>


<h3><i>A Pun.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;You</span> have not enough devil in you, Abe, to succeed
in the task you have undertaken,&#8221; said a
bosom friend of the President&#8217;s. &#8220;Well, blame
my old father,&#8221; said the President, &#8220;for it was
he who left the <i>l</i> (hell) out of Abe&mdash;Ab(<i>l</i>)e.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Sojourner Truth.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Sojourner Truth visited the present occupant
of the White House, the President gave him
a most hearty welcome. &#8220;Lies,&#8221; said he, &#8220;are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
pictured as being black as Erebus; but thou,
<i>Truth</i>, art black also.&#8221; The most numerous lies,
said the sable skin, are <i>white lies</i>.</p>


<h3><i>The National Debt.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;I have</span> come to consult you on the enormous
increase of our national debt,&#8221; said Chase to his
master; &#8220;but perhaps you would rather I deferred
it for the present?&#8221; &#8220;By no means,&#8221; was the
reply; &#8220;<i>its great interest</i> claims my most devout
attention.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Falsely Telegraphed.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> it was falsely telegraphed that Charlestown
was in flames, the President explained his
disbelief by saying that he believed it was a
<i>flaming</i> lie!</p>


<h3><i>The Sword and the Law.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> President was lamenting to a lawyer the
immense number who fell at the battle of &mdash;&mdash;.
The lawyer, to soothe him, said &#8220;That those who
live by the sword must expect to die by the
sword!&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Abe; &#8220;and those who
live by the law must expect to die by the law.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Pepper</i> v. <i>Laurels.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> it was telegraphed that Rosencranz had
gone to <i>Cullpepper</i>, Abe said &#8220;It was a foolish
errand, and that the general was sent out to <i>cull
laurels</i>.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Abe at the Play.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Abe,</span> who is very fond of theatricals, went, upon
a recent occasion, to the theatre to see a new
play. The friend, who was with him, remarked
upon the thinness of the house, and said he supposed
it was owing to the war. &#8220;No,&#8221; replied
the jester; &#8220;it is not owing to the war, it is
owing to the <i>piece</i>.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>Abe and the Officer.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A craven-hearted</span> officer was boasting the
other day to Lincoln of the wounds he had received
in his face. The President, however,
knowing him to be a coward, told him he had
better take care the next time he ran away how
he looked back.</p>


<h3><i>Anecdote.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a dinner the President recently gave at the
White House, he was much amused by the following
anecdote, related by one of the officers who
had just returned from a northern victory. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the battle the rain came pouring down to such an
extent that he remarked to a companion, who
stood by, (an Irishman) that it reminded him of
the <i>general deluge</i>. &#8220;And faith,&#8221; says Pat,
&#8220;who&#8217;s that? I never heard of that general
before.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>The Scotch Editor.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this same dinner party there was a Scotchman,
an editor of one of the northern newspapers.
Opposite to him, at the table, sat a gentleman who
had indulged pretty freely in his cups. In the
course of conversation he asked the Scotchman
&#8220;What was the difference between a Scott and a
Lot?&#8221; To this the Scotchman replied, that &#8220;the
difference lay in the breadth of the table.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>The Senator.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> senator, not the highest ornament to
the White House, had a custom of shaking his
head when another member spoke. The speaker
complained of this as an affront. The President,
however, took it good humouredly, and assured
his friend that although the gentleman often
shook his head, there was nothing in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Common Sense.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A fop,</span> who was in a company where the President
attended, was boasting that he had every <i>sense</i> in
perfection. Old Abe, however, hinted to a friend
&#8220;that there was one sense which he wanted, and
that was <i>common sense</i>.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>The Epitaph.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> officer of the northern army who was remarkable
for the brilliancy of his fireworks, not connected
with war, was speaking of the beauty of an
epitaph, written upon a friend of his, who had
fallen in battle. His friend was fond of music;
and the officer said he is gone to that place where
only his own harmony can be exceeded. The
President slyly hinted that the same might serve
for him by only altering one word&mdash;&#8220;He is
gone to that place where only his own fireworks
can be excelled.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>A Metaphor.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Abe</span> had a book sent to him by a certain author,
&#8220;<i>Le Journal Janet</i>,&#8221; with a passage in it; that
the author thought might be justified, and said
it was a metaphor. &#8220;Well,&#8221; said the President,
&#8220;it is such an one as I never <i>met-a-fore</i>.&#8221;</p>

Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
